1.Write a Python program to add two numbers using class and object.

class Test:

    def findsum(self, a, b):
        s = a + b
        return s


a = int(input("Enter first number:"))
b = int(input("Enter second number:"))

obj = Test()
s = obj.findsum(a, b)

print("Sum is:", s)


Define a function swap that should swap two values and print the swapped variables outside the
swap function.

x = 10
y = 5
 
# Code to swap 'x' and 'y'
x = x ^ y; # x now becomes 15 (1111)
y = x ^ y; # y becomes 10 (1010)
x = x ^ y; # x becomes 5 (0101)
 
print ("After Swapping: x = ", x, " y =", y)
